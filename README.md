# App_CRUD_sqlServer_Rm
# ============

## Project : prjWin_App_CRUD_sqlServer_Rm
Fall-2018

The objective : Implementing Basic CRUD Functionality.


## Getting started

Introduction to the relation between a SQL Server database and the C# programming language.


## YouTube.

[CRUD MVC C# Sql server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H8vswpMSOw&t=650s)

[C# Databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdDkFPO_nto)

## Interface : Application View

With C # We develop the classes and functions for the CRUD application

## tclient : SQL Server

With SQL Server we developed the scripts to create the data base, the table and the Stored procedures.

## Important.

#### MVC : Model View Controller.

[Model View Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)

 * Model:      *It should be responsible for the data of the application domain.*
 * View:       *It presents the display of the model in the user interface.*
 * Controller: *It is really the heart of the MVC, the intermediary that ties the Model and the View together.*
               *The controller takes user input, manipulates the model & causes the view to update*

When we have this pattern in one application (MVC pattern), we can reuse code in other application
and work in parallel whit others developers.
